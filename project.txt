Here’s what you should definitely build and polish:
1. Admin Analytics Dashboard (Core Feature)

Build a clean admin interface (React, Vue, or even FastAPI + Jinja if you want simple).
The admin can:

View all orders (user info, product info, location, delivery status).

Filter by delivery status (Pending, Out for Delivery, Delivered).

View live metrics (total sales, top-selling products, delivery times, etc.).

Use a charting library (Chart.js, Recharts, or Plotly) to visualize:

Total orders by day.

Revenue trends.

Delivery time averages.

2. Geolocation and Distance Tracking

This part can seriously make your project stand out if done well.

Use Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap (OSRM API) to:

Fetch latitude/longitude of users and warehouses.

Calculate shortest delivery routes using routing algorithms (Dijkstra or A*).

Show this visually on a map (admin can click an order and see route on a map).

Bonus: Cache location data and distances in Redis to reduce API calls.

3. Real-Time Delivery Tracking

Simulate a delivery process — it’s not hard if you structure it smartly.

Add a “delivery agent” table.

When an order is assigned to a driver, simulate GPS updates (randomized coordinates along the route).

Update order status dynamically on the admin dashboard using WebSockets or FastAPI’s WebSocket routes.

That’s instant visual impact.

4. Order Lifecycle Management

Make your backend handle proper order transitions:
Placed → Packed → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered
Each transition should:

Log a timestamp.

Notify user via email (use FastAPI BackgroundTasks + SMTP).

This shows understanding of state management and asynchronous processing.

5. Recommendation System

Add a small intelligent feature:

After purchase, recommend products “bought together” or “frequently viewed with.”
Use simple logic at first (co-occurrence matrix or most common pairs).

This adds an AI-like touch that catches a senior dev’s eye.

6. Smart Admin Insights

Go beyond dashboards:

Detect delayed deliveries (highlight in red if ETA missed).

Show users with repeated cancellations or returns.

Flag products frequently refunded (potential quality issue).

That’s the kind of thinking like a system seniors respect.

7. Tech Stack Polish

If you’re on FastAPI:

Add async everywhere (especially for DB I/O).

Structure project cleanly:

app/
  ├── api/
  ├── services/
  ├── models/
  ├── schemas/
  ├── core/
  └── utils/


Add Docker + docker-compose.

Use Alembic for migrations.

Write at least 5 unit tests with pytest.

8. Presentation

Deploy it.
Host backend on Render/Railway, database on Neon or Supabase, and admin frontend on Vercel/Netlify.
Then document:

Tech stack

Features

Demo screenshots

API endpoints

A senior developer judges not just your code — but your clarity and system design thinking.
